      desc:"You will get plenty of internship opportunities which you can turn into placements. IT firms like Infosys and TCS are sure to select from the PG students but doing an M. Tech just for getting into Infosys and TCS is not worth the two years. It’s mostly a bad idea to pursue M. Tech at any of the Government or Private Self Financing colleges hoping to get placed in a company of core field. That rarely happens even for B. Techs. It would be better to prepare for GATE using the current situation (Pandemic) to your advantage and try to get at least into the NIT’s if not the IIT’s. Due to the current pandemic it’s going to be a bad placement season this year and most likely the next but could be different from 2022."
